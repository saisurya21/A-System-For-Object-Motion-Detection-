This work detects the object which is missing from the frame by monitoring it every time and send notification to the user if any object is missing from the frame. It constantly monitors the frames and checks which objects or things are taken away form the frame under the surveillance . It also detect the motion occurred in the surveillance .To measure the similarity between two given images we use (SSIM) Structural Similarity Index Metrics. It also identify the persons in the frames by there name(if already registered in the data set). For identifying the person we use (LBPH) Local Binary Pattern Histogram. It also send the both frames to user when a person enters and leaves the room , analyse it and show it to the user.
